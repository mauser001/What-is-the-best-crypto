What is the best Crypto

License: MIT

This dapp is created to find out what the best crypto is and donate money to SOS-Kinderdorf in the process.

The project conists of the smart-contract and the react frontend for it.

The project web3 website is: http://whatisthebest.crypto

All donations are made in MATIC on the Poligon (2nd layer for Ethereum) network and are sent directly to the donation address of SOS-Kinderdorf.

How does it work?
1) Go to the website
2) Login with Metamask on the Polygon Network
3) You donate MATIC and get WITB tokens
4) You burn these tokens and the one who burns the most tokens can define what the best crypto curreny is. 

I tried my best to make everything as straight forward as possible, but I do not take any responsability if there are bugs and something goes wrong. Use at your own risk!
