What is the best Crypto

License: MIT

This dapp is created to find out what the best crypto is and donate money to SOS-Kinderdorf in the process.

The project conists of the smart-contract and the react frontend for it.

The project web3 website is: http://whatisthebest.crypto

All donations are made in MATIC on the Poligon (2nd layer for Ethereum) network and are sent directly to the donation address of SOS-Kinderdorf.

I tried my best to make everything as straight forward as possible, but I do not take any responsability if there are bugs and something goes wrong. Use at your own risk!
